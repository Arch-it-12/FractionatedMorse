I decided to do a two part cipher known as the fractionated morse cipher, which I found here:
http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/classical-era/fractionated-morse/.  It is essentially a two part substitution
cipher that uses morse code, and then a mixed alphabet key for each combination of three character (., -, x) (x
indicating a character gap and xx indicating a space)

I began by implementing the private fields, of which there are a few.  First, the key, which is just the alphabet in some random order,
I also had a key part two, which I would append to the original key in order to create an associated list to the morese code list
The morse code list was just all of the alphabet, all of the special characters, and then all of the number.

There was also a special table which would be used to convert the morse code into the encoded letters.

So the encode now just had to iterate through the message and append the associated morse code to a string builder.  If there was a space an xx would be added
and there was an x between every character.  Now I made sure the character count was divisible by three for the next step.
I now iterated through three characters at a time and replaced them in accordance to the special table, creating my encoded message.

The decode literally did the exact same thing backwards.

I now worked on the cipherapp, which was just a lot of input taking and checking.
